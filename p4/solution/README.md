Analysis: In Round Robin (RR) scheduling, each process is given an equal slice of CPU time, regardless of its assigned tickets.
          In Stride scheduling, processes with more tickets are scheduled more frequently because they have lower stride values.
          This provides a more flexible approach than RR for prioritizing high-ticket processes while ensuring low-ticket processes still receive some CPU time
          Dynamic adjustment ensures that new or returning processes are integrated smoothly into the scheduling cycle.
